# WaveNet Language Model

An auto-regressive character-level model inspired by the **WaveNet** architecture. Tokens are grouped together sequentially before predicting the next token.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Install Marimo**  
   First, install Marimo by visiting the [Marimo website](https://marimo.io/).

2. **Run the notebook**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   marimo edit wavenet_lm.py
   ``` 
   Execute the cells. Pay attention to the code and comments throughout.

## Objectives

This project is primarily for learning. I have aimed to explain my thought process and reasoning behind the code. You'll notice a lot of testing in the cells labeled as **Scratchpad**.
